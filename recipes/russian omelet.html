<h1>Description</h1>

<p><font size="5">An omelette (sometimes written omelet) is a dish formed with beaten eggs and <br>  fried in a frying pan with butter or oil (without stirring as in scrambled egg)<br>. Folding the omelette around contents like chives, vegetables, mushrooms,<br>  meat ,cheese, onions, or a mix of the aforementioned is extremely frequent<br>. A tiny amount of milk, cream, or water is often used to beat whole eggs or egg whites.</font></p>

<p> <font size="5"> Omelets are the perfect breakfast option. They're healthy, filling, and they're simply delicious<br> . They're even great for both vegetarians and meat eaters alike. The many health benefits, though,<br>  are reason enough to love the omelet.Two of the most common variations in the United States<br>  are the "Denver" and "Southwest." Both contain generous amounts of cheddar cheese,<br>  bell peppers, and usually diced ham; Denver versions are often topped <br> with hot sauce, while Southwest dishes may come with salsa and sour cream. </font></p>
